need to track cattle when they go off to graze

**Youtube video on problem :** https://youtu.be/Eyv93STNEFQ

### Problem description
My mother needs to allow 4 cows in my home to graze around the home. she cannot be present all the time around the cows as she needs to finish her household works as well as tend to the fields. At the end of the day she needs to get all of these cows to shed. Most time 1 or the other cows wonder off looking for better pastures and she has to take a while to search for them. She looses valuable milking time as well as time need for her evening chores.

It would be nice if she could track her cows in some way, not necessarily at all times. Normally she would want to find the cows as fast as possible when she goes looking for them at the end of the day.

Ideally a mobile based solution would be great for her as she carries one most of the time.

### Have's
My mother has a feature mobile phone with bluetooth. 

### Have not's 
My mother does not have access to Internet. There is no wifi on her phone. 

### Constraints 
my mother cannot read well. So it might be good to signal her with sound when the cow/s is found. She will be able to press button on mobile screen to start application.
